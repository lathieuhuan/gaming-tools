            {markYellow("Teammate details")} on a setup can be viewed when you press a teammate icon. Here you can build
            a setup for that teammate based on the main setup. Party members and Target will be the same. Some modifiers
            will remain activated and keep their inputs.

            {markYellow("Complex Setup")} is the result of combining setups of the same 4 party members. You can break
            this complex into individual setups again by pressing the <FaUnlink /> before its name. Now at teammate
            details you can switch to that setup.

            You CANNOT change teammates when modifying the direct copy of a setup that is in a complex. However you can
